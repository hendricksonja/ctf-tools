# CTF Toolbox

Welcome! This site is a reference for common tools used to solve Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges.

It’s meant to answer two questions for students:

1. **“What tools should I try for this type of challenge?”**
2. **“What are the basic commands and where is the official documentation?”**

---

## Start Here

If you’re in the middle of a CTF and just need something fast:

- 👉 **Go to the [Cheat Sheet](cheatsheet.md)** for a quick “if you see X, try Y tools” guide and copy-paste commands.

If you’re learning tools more deeply or doing prep:

- 📚 **See the [Full Toolbox](toolbox.md)** for detailed descriptions, tags (web, pwn, forensics, etc.), common options, examples, and links to official docs.

## How to Use This Site

1. **Figure out what you’re looking at**

   - File, image, binary → probably forensics / reverse / pwn.
   - URL or web app → web.
   - PCAP → forensics / network.
   - Weird text or hashes → crypto / encoding.

2. **Open the Cheat Sheet**

   - Find the row that matches your situation.
   - Try 1–2 of the suggested tools and example commands.

3. **Open the Full Toolbox (optional)**

   - When you want to understand a tool better or see more options.
   - Each tool entry includes:
     - Tags (`web`, `pwn`, `forensics`, `crypto`, …)
     - Typical uses
     - Common commands
     - Links to the official documentation or GitHub repo.
